<h1>Problem</h1>

Being in New England, it can definitely be a struggle to locate where others may be paddleboarding, surfing, kayaking or whichever water activity they are enjoying. Especially during the little warm weather we do have!

Water sports/activities is a lifestyle and can of course be enjoyed alone. But, it is nice to have some company! Not only for sociality but for safety as well.

There needs to be a way to easily connect with fellow water enthusiasts - no matter the water activity they are doing!

# Solution

Purpose: to easily see where fellow water adventurers are out and about
How it works:
Create an account
Add your water activities/sports to your account
Post a meetup where you would like others to have the opportunity to join you. Or, search for meetups yourself!
“Register” one of your water activities to that meetup post.
